            CRS is a software system created in April of 2022 which can be used by individuals out in
            the field recovering lost
            children who have lost contact with their parents/guardians. This system seeks
            to ease and speed up the process of reconnecting lost children back with their families by the relevant
            authorities.

            The system works by accepting user input in the form of metadata which constitutes the
            attributes of the child such as
            height, age and hair colour. This data is used to
            perform
            a matching function which
            generates a list of possible
            matches for the child's
            parent(s)/guardian(s). Good job!
